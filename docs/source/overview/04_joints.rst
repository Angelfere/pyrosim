Joints
======

Joints connect bodies to other bodies or to points in the world.
By default they are unactuated.
Adding actuators to joints will power them.


Hinge Joints
------------

Hinge joints allow two bodies to rotate with respect to each other about a specified axis.
Hinge joints are useful for creating appendages, axles, and many more objects. 

Slider Joints
-------------

Slider joints allow two bodies to move laterally with respect to one another in the direction of a specified axis.
Slider joints are useful for piston-like objects.

Universal Joints
----------------


Ball and Socket Joints
----------------------

Ball and socket joints keep two bodies the same distance away from a designated anchor.
They are similar to universal joints but have an extra degree of rotation.
